            make it possible to store specific user-related information on the
            user's device. These allow an analysis of the use of our website

            to a Google server in the USA and stored there. We point out that on
            this website Google Analytics has been extended by the code
            "gat._anonymizeIp ();" in order to ensure an anonymous collection of
            IP addresses (so-called IP-Masking). If the anonymization is active,
            Google truncates IP addresses within member states of the European
            Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the
            European Economic Area, and therefore no identification of your
            identity is possible. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP
            address be sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there.
