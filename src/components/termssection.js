            control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us,
            and you agree to cooperate, at your expense, with our defense of
            such claims. We will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any

            These Terms of Use and any policies or operating rules posted by us
            on the App constitute the entire agreement and understanding between
            you and us. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or
            provision of these Terms of Use shall not operate as a waiver of
            such right or provision. These Terms of Use operate to the fullest
            extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our rights
            and obligations to others at any time. We shall not be responsible
            or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act caused by
            any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any provision or part of
            a provision of these Terms of Use is determined to be unlawful,
            void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is
            deemed severable from these Terms of Use and does not affect the
            validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no
            joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship
            created between you and us as a result of these Terms of Use or use
            of the App. You agree that these Terms of Use will not be construed
            against us by virtue of having drafted them. You hereby waive any
            and all defenses you may have based on the electronic form of these
            Terms of Use and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to
            execute these Terms of Use.{" "}
